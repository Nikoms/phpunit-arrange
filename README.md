# phpunit-arrange

* Do "Arrange" (Arrange-Act-Assert style) in annotations
* Make your tests easier to read
* Dramatically reduce your messy "setUp" method!
* Only put the real important mock/expect in your test method, the rest is the annotation


## TO DO

* Add all build stuff like travis to test the lib on all php and phpunit versions...
* Add it to packagist
* Write the doc (basically, it's just adding a listener)
* Try to call the listener without adding it in the xml (see phpunit-bridge?)
* Try to integrate it in "--testdox"
